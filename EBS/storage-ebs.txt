Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) üóÉÔ∏è
Overview: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers scalable storage for data objects, files, and backups. It provides durability, high availability, and low latency access to your data.


Bucket Naming Rules:
Bucket names must be globally unique across AWS.
Names can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods.
Bucket names must be between 3 and 63 characters in length.

S3 Subresources:
Objects: Data items stored in S3, identified by a unique key.
Metadata: Custom data associated with objects.
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Define who can access objects and what they can do.
Bucket Policies: JSON-based policies to manage permissions at the bucket level.
Versioning: Maintain multiple versions of an object within a bucket.
Lifecycle Policies: Automate object transitions, archiving, and deletions.
MFA Delete: Add an extra layer of security by requiring Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for object deletion.


Bucket Lifecycle:
Use Lifecycle policies to define rules for object transitions between storage classes and automatic deletion.
For example, you can move objects to Glacier after a certain period and delete objects after a specific date.


Bucket Versioning:
Enable versioning to keep multiple versions of objects in the same bucket.
Helps recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.


MFA Delete:
Requires Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to delete objects or enable versioning.
Provides an added layer of security for critical data.


Multipart Upload:
Allows you to upload large objects in smaller parts (parts can be uploaded in parallel).
Useful for resumable uploads and improved efficiency.


Copying in S3:
You can copy objects within the same bucket or across buckets.
Copying objects is a non-destructive operation.
Can be used for data replication, backups, or data movement.

Amazon S3 Storage Classes üì¶


Standard:
The default storage class, suitable for frequently accessed data.
Provides high availability and durability.


Intelligent-Tiering:
Automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns.
Cost-effective for unpredictable workloads.



One Zone-IA (Infrequent Access):
Stores data in a single Availability Zone.
Lower cost than Standard IA, suitable for less critical data.


Glacier:
Low-cost archival storage with a retrieval delay.
Suitable for long-term data retention.


Glacier Deep Archive:
Lowest cost archival storage, with longer retrieval times.
Ideal for data with rare access requirements.
S3 Object Storage Classes Configuration:
Use S3 Lifecycle policies to transition objects between storage classes based on your data access patterns.


Cross-Region Replication üåê
Replicate objects from one S3 bucket in one AWS region to another bucket in a different AWS region.
Helps with data redundancy, compliance, and disaster recovery.


Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) üíΩ
Overview: Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. It offers durability, snapshots, and different volume types.


EBS Volume Types:
General Purpose SSD (gp2): Suitable for a wide range of workloads.
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1): For high-performance applications.
Throughput Optimized HDD (st1): Ideal for sequential, high-throughput workloads.
Cold HDD (sc1): Low-cost option for less frequently accessed data.

EBS Snapshots:
Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes.
Create consistent snapshots without impacting instance performance.
Snapshots are incremental, only changes since the last snapshot are stored.


EBS Encryption:
Encrypts data at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or customer-managed keys.
Supported for all EBS volume types, including root volumes.

Root Volume Encryption:
Encrypts the root volume of an EC2 instance for added security.


EBS Encryption Key:
Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys.

Sharing EBS Snapshots:
Share EBS snapshots with other AWS accounts for collaboration or data migration.
